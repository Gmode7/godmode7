## Questionnaire Style

### Question Format
```
## Question X: [Topic]
[Clear, specific question]

**Why we're asking:** [1-sentence context]
**Example:** [Good example answer]
```

### Do:
- Ask one thing per question
- Provide context for why we're asking
- Give examples of good answers
- Use bullet points for multi-part questions

### Don't:
- Ask compound questions ("How and when and why...")
- Use technical jargon
- Be overly formal or stiff
- Rush the client

### Section Headers
Use standard headers consistently:
```markdown
## Project Overview
## Problem Statement
